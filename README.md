# Git 101 Workshop - Spirit Animals!

The challenge is to add a line to this file (in order!) with your name and your spirit animal.

2. Steve  - My  spirit animal is the goat, because it will eat anything.
4. Yasemin - My spririt animal is a bird, because it will fly anywhere it wants.
6. Ian - My spirit animal is a terrier, as I'd rather be running aimlessly around a field
